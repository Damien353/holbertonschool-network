# What Happens When You Type `https://www.google.com` and Press Enter?

It's something we do every day: you open your browser, type a web address, and a webpage loads in an instant. But behind the scenes, a complex series of steps is executed in milliseconds. In this article, we‚Äôll break down what actually happens, covering **DNS**, **TCP/IP**, **firewalls**, **HTTPS/SSL**, **load balancers**, **web servers**, **application servers**, and **databases**.

## 1. DNS Resolution: Finding Google's IP Address

When you type `https://www.google.com`, the first step is to translate that domain name into an IP address. This is done via a **DNS** (Domain Name System) request.

- The browser first checks if the IP address is already cached.
- If not, it asks your ISP‚Äôs DNS resolver.
- The resolver queries the root servers, then the `.com` TLD servers, and finally Google's authoritative DNS server.

üîç Example: `www.google.com ‚Üí 142.250.190.100`

## 2. Establishing the Connection via TCP/IP

Once the IP address is found, your computer initiates a connection with the server using the **TCP/IP** protocol.

- **IP (Internet Protocol)** finds the route to the destination.
- **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)** establishes a reliable connection through a 3-way handshake (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK).

This ensures data can be exchanged accurately and in order.

---

## 3. Passing Through Firewalls

**Firewalls** are security systems between your device and the internet (and also on Google‚Äôs side).

- They inspect network packets and may block suspicious traffic.
- If the request is legitimate (port 443 for HTTPS, trusted IP), it passes through.

---

## 4. Securing the Connection with HTTPS/SSL

Since the URL starts with `https://`, the browser initiates a secure connection using **SSL/TLS** (TLS is the modern version of SSL).

- The browser sends a *ClientHello* message with supported encryption options.
- Google's server responds with its **SSL certificate**, proving its identity.
- A **session key** is securely negotiated for encrypting the communication.

üîê Result: the data exchanged between you and Google is **encrypted and secure**.

---

## 5. Routing Through a Load Balancer

Google uses **load balancers** to distribute incoming requests across multiple servers.

- The load balancer receives the HTTPS request.
- It selects an available **web server** based on factors like current load and location.
- This ensures fast response times and high availability.

---

## 6. Web Server Processing

The **web server** (like Nginx or a custom Google server) receives the request.

- It handles basic content like static files (HTML, CSS, JS).
- If the request is dynamic (e.g., a Google search), it forwards it to an **application server**.

---

## 7. Business Logic on the Application Server

The **application server** handles the core business logic.

- It interprets the request (e.g., ‚Äúsearch for ChatGPT‚Äù).
- It interacts with other services or databases to generate a response.
- In Google‚Äôs case, this is where search algorithms are triggered.

---

## 8. Database Access

The application server queries one or more **databases**.

- These contain indexed data about web pages, images, videos, and more.
- The search engine ranks and organizes the results based on relevance.

---

## 9. Sending the Response Back to Your Browser

- The final response (HTML + CSS + JS) is returned to the web server.
- It‚Äôs routed back through the load balancer, encrypted via TLS, and sent through the firewalls to you.
- The browser decrypts, parses, and displays the page.

## Conclusion

In just milliseconds, typing a URL triggers a chain of events involving:

‚úÖ DNS resolution  
‚úÖ Secure connection via TCP/IP + SSL  
‚úÖ Load balancing  
‚úÖ Application logic execution  
‚úÖ Massive database queries  
‚úÖ Rendering in your browser

All that, just to perform a simple Google search.
